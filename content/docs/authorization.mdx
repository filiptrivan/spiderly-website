description: Learn how to configure authorization for entity CRUD operations in your Spiderly application.

## Overview

By default, all entities require authorization for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. If your code encounters an authorization issue (e.g., an `UnauthorizedException - You don't have the necessary rights to perform the operation.`), it means the current user lacks the necessary permissions.

<Callout type="warn">
**Skipping Authorization:** If you want to explicitly bypass authorization for an entity, you can apply the `[DoNotAuthorize]` attribute. This disables all security checks for that entity across all operations.
</Callout>

If your entity requires access control, follow the steps in this tutorial to configure proper authorization.

## Add Permissions to Your Application

Navigate to your `ApplicationDbContext.cs` file:

```
Backend\{your-app-name}.Infrastructure\{your-app-name}ApplicationDbContext.cs
```

In the `SeedData` method, add your entity permissions to the permissions array. Replace `YourEntityName` with your actual entity name:

```csharp
private static void SeedData(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    Permission[] permissions =
    [
        // ... existing permissions ...

        // Add your new entity permissions
        new Permission { Id = 13, Name = "View YourEntityName", Code = "ReadYourEntityName" },
        new Permission { Id = 14, Name = "Edit existing YourEntityName", Code = "UpdateYourEntityName" },
        new Permission { Id = 15, Name = "Add new YourEntityName", Code = "InsertYourEntityName" },
        new Permission { Id = 16, Name = "Delete YourEntityName", Code = "DeleteYourEntityName" },
    ];

    modelBuilder.Entity<Permission>().HasData(permissions);

    // ... rest of seed data ...
}
```

**Important**: Make sure to use sequential IDs that don't conflict with existing permissions.

After adding the permissions, create and apply a migration:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddYourEntityNamePermissions --project Backend/{your-app-name}.Infrastructure --startup-project Backend/{your-app-name}.API
dotnet ef database update --project Backend/{your-app-name}.Infrastructure --startup-project Backend/{your-app-name}.API
```

## Assign Permissions to a Role

In the application UI:

1. Navigate to *Administration → Roles*.
2. Select the role you want to modify.
3. In the **Permissions** control, add the newly created permissions.

This ensures users assigned to this role will have access to the specified entity operations.

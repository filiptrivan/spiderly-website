## Initialize the App

Open a terminal in the folder **where you want your app to be created** and run:

## Open the Project

Navigate into your newly created app folder and open it in VS Code:

```bash
cd your-app-name
code .

  If the `code .` command doesn’t work, open your newly created app folder manually in VS Code.
</Callout>

Press `F5` to start the app.

## Register the User

Use the UI of your generated app to register a new user via email.

## Overview

The EF Core entity and its attributes form the foundation of everything in Spiderly. All other components are built and generated based on these entities.

In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to create a new entity in your project using the Spiderly CLI, which automates the entire process including backend entity creation, frontend page generation, routing, and navigation menu setup.

## Add New Entity

Run the following command from the root of your application:

```bash
spiderly add-new-entity
```

Or, if you want to generate a data view instead of a table for the list page:

```bash
spiderly add-new-entity --data-view
```

The CLI will prompt you to enter the entity name in PascalCase (e.g., `YourEntityName`).

This command will automatically generate:

1. **Backend Entity**:
   - `Backend\YourAppName.Business\Entities\YourEntityName.cs`

2. **List Page**:
   - `Frontend\src\app\pages\your-entity-name\your-entity-name-list.component.ts`
   - `Frontend\src\app\pages\your-entity-name\your-entity-name-list.component.html`

3. **Details Page**:
   - `Frontend\src\app\pages\your-entity-name\your-entity-name-details.component.ts`
   - `Frontend\src\app\pages\your-entity-name\your-entity-name-details.component.html`

4. **Routes** in `Frontend\src\app\app.routes.ts`

5. **Menu Item** in `Frontend\src\app\business\layout\layout.component.ts`

## Customize the Entity

After generation, open the entity file at `Backend\YourAppName.Business\Entities\YourEntityName.cs` and customize it according to your needs.

The entity class inherits from `BusinessObject<ID>` which supports create, read, update and delete operations. If you need a read-only entity that does not support create, update, or delete operations from the UI, change the base class to `ReadonlyObject<ID>`.

### Example of a customized entity:

```csharp
namespace YourAppName.Business.Entities
{
    [DoNotAuthorize]
    public class YourEntityName : BusinessObject<long>
    {
        [StringLength(75, MinimumLength = 1)]
        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [UIControlType(nameof(UIControlTypeCodes.TextArea))]
        [StringLength(500, MinimumLength = 1)]
        public string Description { get; set; }
    }
}
```

## Add Your Entity to the Database

Open a terminal in the `Backend` folder and run the following commands to create and apply a migration:

```bash
spiderly add-migration YourMigrationName
spiderly update-database
```

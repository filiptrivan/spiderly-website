## Overview

The EF Core entity and its attributes form the foundation of everything in Spiderly. All other components are built and generated based on these entities.

In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to create a new entity in your project. This includes adding it to the backend, updating the database, and generating the corresponding frontend code.

## Add New Entity

Locate the `Backend\YourAppName.Business\Entities` folder and add a new public class for your entity (e.g., `YourEntityName.cs`).

The entity class must inherit from `BusinessObject<ID>` if it supports create, read, update and delete operations, or from `ReadonlyObject<ID>` if it is read-only and does not support create, update, or delete operations from the UI.

### Example of an entity:

```csharp
namespace YourAppName.Business.Entities
{
    [DoNotAuthorize]
    [TranslatePluralEn("Your entity plural name")]
    public class YourEntityName : BusinessObject<long>
    {
        [StringLength(75, MinimumLength = 1)]
        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [UIControlType(nameof(UIControlTypeCodes.TextArea))]
        [StringLength(500, MinimumLength = 1)]
        public string Description { get; set; }
    }
}
```

## Add Your Entity to the Database

Open a terminal in the `Backend` folder and run the following commands to create and apply a migration:

**Create a migration:**

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add YourMigrationScriptName --project YourAppName.Infrastructure --startup-project YourAppName.WebAPI
```

**Apply the migration to the database:**

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project YourAppName.Infrastructure --startup-project YourAppName.WebAPI
```

## Generate Components

Use the **Spiderly CLI** to generate a default template for your new entity. You can customize the generated files afterwards.

Run the following command from the root of your application:

```bash
spiderly add-new-page
```

This will generate the following files:

1. **List Page**:
   - `Frontend\src\app\pages\your-entity-name\your-entity-name-list.component.ts`
   - `Frontend\src\app\pages\your-entity-name\your-entity-name-list.component.html`

2. **Details Page**:
   - `Frontend\src\app\pages\your-entity-name\your-entity-name-details.component.ts`
   - `Frontend\src\app\pages\your-entity-name\your-entity-name-details.component.html`

## Define Routes for Your Page

Open the `Frontend\src\app\app.routes.ts` file and add new route objects to the `layoutRoutes` array:

```typescript
{
    path: 'your-entity-name', // URL for the list page (e.g., /your-entity-name)
    loadComponent: () => import('./pages/your-entity-name/your-entity-name-list.component').then(c => c.YourEntityNameListComponent),
    canActivate: [AuthGuard],
},
{
    path: 'your-entity-name/:id', // URL for the details page (e.g., /your-entity-name/123)
    loadComponent: () => import('./pages/your-entity-name/your-entity-name-details.component').then(c => c.YourEntityNameDetailsComponent),
    canActivate: [AuthGuard],
},
```

## Add the Page to the Navigation Menu

Open the `Frontend\src\app\business\layout\layout.component.ts` file.

Locate the `this.menu` array and add a new menu item object for your entity. Use the following structure as a reference:

```typescript
{
    label: this.translocoService.translate('YourEntityName'),
    icon: 'pi pi-fw pi-question', // Refer to https://primeng.org/icons#list for available icons
    routerLink: ['your-entity-name'], // Must match the list page path defined in app.routes.ts
    visible: true,
},
```

title: Entity Authorization - Create, Read, Update, Delete
description: Learn how to configure authorization for entity operations in your Spiderly application.
---

## Overview

By default, all entities require authorization for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. If your code encounters an authorization issue (e.g., an `UnauthorizedException - You don't have the necessary rights to perform the operation.`), it means the current user lacks the necessary permissions.

⚠️ **Skipping Authorization**: If you want to **explicitly bypass authorization** for an entity, you can apply the `[DoNotAuthorize]` attribute. This disables all security checks for that entity across all operations.

If your entity requires access control, follow the steps in this tutorial to configure proper authorization.

## Insert Permissions into the Database

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance (see [Step 9 in the Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started#connect-to-sql-server)).
3. Locate your application database in the Object Explorer.
4. Right-click the database and select *New Query*.
5. Execute the SQL commands below, replacing `YourEntityName` with the actual entity name:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Permission (Name, Description, Code) VALUES (N'View YourEntityName', NULL, N'ReadYourEntityName');
INSERT INTO Permission (Name, Description, Code) VALUES (N'Edit existing YourEntityName', NULL, N'UpdateYourEntityName');
INSERT INTO Permission (Name, Description, Code) VALUES (N'Add new YourEntityName', NULL, N'InsertYourEntityName');
INSERT INTO Permission (Name, Description, Code) VALUES (N'Delete YourEntityName', NULL, N'DeleteYourEntityName');

COMMIT;
```

## Assign Permissions to a Role

In the application UI:

1. Navigate to *Administration → Roles*.
2. Select the role you want to modify.
3. In the **Permissions** control, add the newly created permissions.

This ensures users assigned to this role will have access to the specified entity operations.
